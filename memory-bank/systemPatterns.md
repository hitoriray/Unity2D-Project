# System Patterns

## Creational Patterns

*   **Object Pool:** Implemented in `ObjectPool.cs`. This pattern is used to manage reusable objects like `StarProjectile` and `DamageText` instances to reduce the performance overhead of frequent instantiation and destruction.
*   **Scriptable Objects for Configuration:** Weapon and Tile data are configured using ScriptableObjects (`Weapon.cs`, `Tile.cs`). This decouples configuration from game logic, allowing designers to easily create and modify game assets without changing code.

## Structural Patterns

*   **Facade:** The `LightingManager.cs` acts as a facade for the complex lighting subsystem, providing a simplified interface (`LightBlock`, `UnlightBlock`) for other parts of the game to interact with the lighting engine.

## Behavioral Patterns

*   **Observer (Implicit):** The use of the `IDamageable` interface creates a form of the Observer pattern. Any object implementing this interface can "subscribe" to being damaged, and the combat system can notify it of damage events without needing to know the concrete type of the object.
