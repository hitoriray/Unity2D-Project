# Active Context

## Current Focus

The Ambiance System's core components (data structures, manager logic, biome detection, and timer-based day/night cycle) are now implemented. The next step is to test the complete system to ensure background images and music change correctly based on biome and time of day, including smooth transitions.

### Key Requirements for Ambiance System (Recap):
*   Different background images for Forest, Desert, Surface, Cave biomes.
*   Different background music for these biomes.
*   Different music and images for Day vs. Night.
*   Image and music transitions should use fade effects.

## Previous Focus (Completed on 2025-06-14)

*   **DayNightCycleManager Automation:** Implemented an automatic, timer-based day/night cycle in `DayNightCycleManager.cs`, removing the debug variable and adding configurable durations.
*   **AmbianceManager Integration:** Integrated `AmbianceManager.cs` with actual biome detection and initial time of day detection.
*   **Lighting System:** Resolved issues with the "Starfury" weapon's temporary lighting.

## Recent Changes Log (Summary)

*   **[2025-06-14]** `DayNightCycleManager.cs` updated with timer-based automatic day/night cycle logic, configurable durations, and removal of debug variables.
*   **[2025-06-14]** `AmbianceManager.cs` integrated with `TerrainGeneration` for biome detection and `DayNightCycleManager` (using a debug variable initially) for time detection. `DayNightCycleManager.cs` created. `TerrainGeneration.GetAmbianceBiomeTypeAtWorldPosition()` confirmed/implemented.
*   **[2025-06-14]** `AmbianceManager.cs` core logic implemented (profile matching, fade coroutines).
*   **[2025-06-14]** User completed Unity Editor setup for `AmbianceManager`.
*   **[2025-06-14]** Created `Assets/Scripts/Ambiance/AmbianceSystemData.cs` and `Assets/Scripts/Ambiance/README.md`.
*   **[2025-06-14]** Successfully fixed cave lighting issue in `LightingManager.cs`.
