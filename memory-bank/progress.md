# Progress Tracker

## Completed Tasks

*   **[DONE]** Implement `IDamageable` interface for handling damage.
*   **[DONE]** Create `StarProjectile` prefab and script for the Starfury weapon.
*   **[DONE]** Modify `PlayerController` to spawn projectiles on attack.
*   **[DONE]** Implement `EnemyHealth` to receive damage and die.
*   **[DONE]** Create a `DamageTextManager` to display floating damage numbers.
*   **[DONE]** Integrate an `ObjectPool` for projectiles and damage text to optimize performance.
*   **[DONE]** Add sound effects for weapon swings and enemy hits.
*   **[DONE]** Implement initial temporary lighting for Starfury projectiles.
*   **[DONE]** Debug and refine the Starfury's temporary lighting effect, ensuring caves return to darkness. (Successfully resolved by modifying `LightBlockInternal` with `applyWallBoost` parameter and updating `RemoveLightSource` calls).
*   **[DONE]** Implement `AmbianceManager` core logic (profile matching, fade coroutines, initial stubs for biome/time).
*   **[DONE]** Integrate `AmbianceManager` with actual Biome detection (via `TerrainGeneration`) and Time of Day detection (via `DayNightCycleManager` using a debug variable).

## In Progress

*   **[IN PROGRESS]** Design and implement a framework for dynamic background music and images.
    *   **Sub-task:** Support different background images for various biomes (surface, caves, forest, desert, etc.). (Initial setup done)
    *   **Sub-task:** Support different background music for various biomes. (Initial setup done)
    *   **Sub-task:** Support different music and images for day vs. night. (Initial setup done)
    *   **Sub-task:** Create a flexible framework to manage these assets and transitions. (Core `AmbianceManager` logic implemented)
    *   **Sub-task:** Implement timer-based automatic day/night cycle in `DayNightCycleManager.cs` [IN PROGRESS - Implementing timer logic]
